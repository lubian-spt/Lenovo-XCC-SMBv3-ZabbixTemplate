Hi!

For this template to work, some configurations are needed in the XCC. 
First, you have to configure the location and contact on Server configuration > server properties;
Then, create a SNMPv3 user on Events > Alerts Recipients; Click Create, fill the address for traps field, and leave all the rest as it is.
For last, go to BMC configuration > Network, select Enable SNMPv3 Agent and click Apply;

After import the template, go to hosts and create a new one and fill the field normally, like Name, templates, groups, except the Interfaces. 

On the interfaces fields you have to Select SNMP, the SNMP Version must be SNMPv3, keep Context name blank. 
On Security name, place the name of the user you just created (default is USERID); On Security level select noAuthNoPriv
